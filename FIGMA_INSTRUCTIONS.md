# Figma Import & Design Assets (instructions)

We provide design specs and assets to recreate the prototype in Figma quickly.

Steps to create a Figma file from this project:
1. Create a new Figma file and set page size to Desktop (1440 x 1024).
2. Use the `design_spec.md` as a guide for typography, colors, and layout.
3. Import logo placeholder from `public/logo.svg` (or create a new brand mark).
4. Create components: Navbar, Hero, Demo Card, Feature Card, Pricing Card, Template Tile, Footer.
5. Use 'Prototype' tab to link CTA buttons to modal frames for demo requests and template previews.

Assets included:
- design_spec.md
- colors & tokens in design_tokens.json
- logo.svg placeholder (create one or replace)

Optional: Use Figma plugins "Content Reel" and "Icons8" to speed up creating icons/components.
